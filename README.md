# Discharge Summary Generator

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to generate medical discharge summaries from uploaded PDF files. It provides two options for generating summaries:
- Clinical discharge summary (detailed, professional format for healthcare providers)
- Patient-friendly discharge summary(simplified and accessible format for patients).

# Features
- Upload PDF documents containing clinical notes.
- Extract content from PDFs and process them using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 model.
- Generate:
  - Detailed discharge summaries for clinicians.
  - Simplified summaries for patients.
- Edit generated summaries before finalizing.
- Download summaries as PDFs.
- Optional SMS notifications using Twilio for patient updates.

# Prerequisites

# System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later.
- Flask and associated libraries.
- Twilio account (optional for SMS functionality).

# Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in your system:
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for Flask sessions.
- `OPENAI_DISCHARGE_API`: OpenAI API key.
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Twilio account SID (for SMS functionality).
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Twilio authentication token (for SMS functionality).
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`: Twilio phone number for sending SMS.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/discharge-summary-generator.git
   cd discharge-summary-generator
   
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   
3. Install dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Configure environment variables in a `.env` file (or export them manually).

5. Run the application:
   bash
   python app.py

# Usage
1. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Upload a PDF file containing clinical notes.
3. Choose to generate either a **clinical** or **patient-friendly** summary.
4. Edit the summary if necessary.
5. Download the finalized summary as a PDF or notify the patient via SMS (optional).

# File Structure
- **`app.py`**: Main application logic.
- **`templates/`**: HTML templates for rendering web pages.
- **`static/asset/`**: Folder for storing uploaded PDFs.
- **`form.py`**: Flask-WTF form definitions.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Dependencies for the application.

# Key Functions
# pdf_to_encoded_imgs(pdf_path)`
Converts PDF pages into base64-encoded images for processing.

# `send_request(encoded_images, custom_prompt)`
Sends encoded images and prompts to OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 model for generating summaries.

# `generate_pdf(html_content)`
Converts HTML content into a downloadable PDF using `xhtml2pdf`.

# `send_sms(message)`
Sends SMS notifications using Twilio (optional).

# Prompts for Summaries
# Patient-Friendly Summary
Generates a concise, easy-to-read discharge summary using laymanâ€™s terms.

# Clinical Summary
Generates a detailed discharge summary with professional formatting and 10 clear headings.

# Dependencies
- `Flask`
- `OpenAI`
- `markdown`
- `pdf2image`
- `xhtml2pdf`
